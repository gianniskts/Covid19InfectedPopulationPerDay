# Covid19InfectedPopulationPerDay
A Covid-19 infected population per day calculator  made for fun during my learning curve in C programming languge.

Welcome to Covid-19 spreading calculator. Give the desired population number and the R number. The result will be days required for the full population infection.
Info: R number is the spreading index. For example: For R=1.2 an infected person spreads to 1.2 people the disease(Covid-19) in the next day
Example Input: 10000000 2. ==> population=10000 R_index=2(1 infected person infects 2 the next day)

Info: R number is the spreading index. For example: For R=1.2 an infected person spreads to 1.2 people the disease(Covid-19) in the next day 
Please input the population number(integer) and the R number(float)
Example Input: 10000000 1.78 ==> population=10000 R_index=1.78(1 infected person infects 1.78 the next day)
10000 1.16

Day 1   ==>   1 person is infected from Covid-19 pandemic

Day 2   ==>   1 people are infected from Covid-19 pandemic started from 1 infected person ------ percentage is 0.000% of new cases

Day 3   ==>   3 people are infected from Covid-19 pandemic started from 1 infected person ------ percentage is 33.333% of new cases

Day 4   ==>   7 people are infected from Covid-19 pandemic started from 1 infected person ------ percentage is 42.857% of new cases

Day 5   ==>   16 people are infected from Covid-19 pandemic started from 1 infected person ------ percentage is 45.161% of new cases

Day 6   ==>   35 people are infected from Covid-19 pandemic started from 1 infected person ------ percentage is 46.269% of new cases

Day 7   ==>   76 people are infected from Covid-19 pandemic started from 1 infected person ------ percentage is 46.528% of new cases

Day 8   ==>   165 people are infected from Covid-19 pandemic started from 1 infected person ------ percentage is 46.452% of new cases

Day 9   ==>   357 people are infected from Covid-19 pandemic started from 1 infected person ------ percentage is 46.407% of new cases

Day 10   ==>   772 people are infected from Covid-19 pandemic started from 1 infected person ------ percentage is 46.357% of new cases

Day 11   ==>   1668 people are infected from Covid-19 pandemic started from 1 infected person ------ percentage is 46.334% of new cases

Day 12   ==>   3604 people are infected from Covid-19 pandemic started from 1 infected person ------ percentage is 46.314% of new cases

Day 13   ==>   7785 people are infected from Covid-19 pandemic started from 1 infected person ------ percentage is 46.307% of new cases

Day 14   ==>   16816 people are infected from Covid-19 pandemic started from 1 infected person ------ percentage is 46.302% of new cases


Finally,  14 days are needed for 10000 of population to be infected from 1 infected person with Covid-19 disease with an R-index of 1.16. 
Furthermore, the infection growth is logarithmic.
