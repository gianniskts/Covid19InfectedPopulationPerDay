# Covid19InfectedPopulationPerDay
A Covid-19 infected population per day calculator  made for fun during my learning curve in C programming languge.

Welcome to Covid-19 spreading calculator. Give the desired population number and the R number. The result will be days required for the full population infection.
Info: R number is the spreading index. For example: For R=1.2 an infected person spreads to 1.2 people the disease(Covid-19) in the next day
Example Input: 10000000 2. ==> population=10000 R_index=2(1 infected person infects 2 the next day)

1000000 2
Day 1   ==>   1 person infected from Covid-19 pandemic
Day 2   ==>   3 people infected from Covid-19 pandemic
Day 3   ==>   9 people infected from Covid-19 pandemic
Day 4   ==>   27 people infected from Covid-19 pandemic
Day 5   ==>   81 people infected from Covid-19 pandemic
Day 6   ==>   243 people infected from Covid-19 pandemic
Day 7   ==>   729 people infected from Covid-19 pandemic
Day 8   ==>   2187 people infected from Covid-19 pandemic
Day 9   ==>   6561 people infected from Covid-19 pandemic
Day 10   ==>   19683 people infected from Covid-19 pandemic
Day 11   ==>   59049 people infected from Covid-19 pandemic
Day 12   ==>   177147 people infected from Covid-19 pandemic
Day 13   ==>   531441 people infected from Covid-19 pandemic
Day 14   ==>   1594323 people infected from Covid-19 pandemic
